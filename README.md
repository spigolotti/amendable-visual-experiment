# amendable-visual-experiment
Python code for the amendable visual experiment

The zip file "visualexperiment.zip" includes code used for the visual experiment in the manuscript "Amendable decisions in living systems". The code is written in Python and requires installation of the library Pygame (www.pygame.org). The practice rounds can be launched using the command: python3 practice.py. This executable permits to select four practice games: irrevocable with aid, irrevocable without aid, amendable with aid, amendable without aid. Each of these games can be played for an arbitrary number of rounds. Pressing q exits the game to the selection screen. The actual experiment session is launched with either: python3 movingdDotGameA.py or: python3 movingdDotGameB.py. The only diﬀerence between the two is the order of the games: movingdDotGameA.py starts with an irrevocable game, whereas movingdDotGameB.py starts with an amendable game. In both cases, games alternate while the diﬃculty level increases as described in Methods.
